# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew!

💻 A beginner frontend developer on a mission to turn caffeine into code.  
🚀 Currently learning JavaScript, React, and how to center a `div` without losing my sanity.

- 🎯 Goal: Become a frontend wizard (React Gandalf, maybe?).
- 🛠️ Building projects that *sometimes* work on the first try!
